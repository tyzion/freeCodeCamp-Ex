            <h2>Brian May</h2>
            <h3>"Challenging and always entertaining. He was a very unpredictable guy, but wonderful to work with. He had a great spatial awareness, and that's something very important. If you're working with people on a stage, you need to have musical contact, but you also need the kind of physical chemistry going on — the awareness of where you are and where you're aiming your energy. Freddie was wonderful for that, and we just clicked from the very beginning. From the days when he was very much a training singer, but he had all the presentation, he had that connection, and it was his amazing kind of skill that he managed to bring himself up to the point where he was using his talent to the best end. He really did work on himself. He was an incredible self-made man."</h3>

            <h2>John Deacon</h2>
            <h3>"Freddie meant a lot of different things to different people, he had a vision of greatness for the band and saw it through. As a perfectionist he always wanted the best and got the best for the band.”</h3>
            <h3>"When you first join you think ‘Maybe you will last five years, ten years at the most when you start playing together for the first time ”</h3>
            <h3>
                “Freddie joked that we all played constantly, with cheeky insinuations: - It always happens. It’s like a cockfight … Four cocks fighting." </h3>
